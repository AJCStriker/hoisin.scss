hoisin.scss
===========

A simple responsive mini framework to kick start your project

## Usage
Open the _vars.scss file and add your variables to it. You can add any variables you will be using like colors, font files, sizes, etc.

To keep it organised, you can add one file for each section, and add common (for each size) styles to the base.scss file. Common styles across the site should go in common.scss.
