hoisin.scss
===========

A simple responsive mini framework to kick start your project, written in Sass. Please note that this project does not include any predefined styling or premade components. We aim to create an organised base from you can create your own library instead of a one-size-fits-all solution.

We did not include a reset since we believe they are not necessary, we encourage you to define the styles you need for your project, and leave the unstyled elements to the browser.

## Usage
Open the _vars.scss file and add your variables to it. You can add any variables you will be using like colors, font files, sizes, etc.

### Grid
By defaul we use a 12 column grid with 60px columns and 20px gutters. The spans have simple names like `".col4"`. There are helper classes like `".colr"` to pull a span to the right, and `".pre1"` to `".pre11"` as well as `".suf1"` to `".suf10"` for offset spans.

Tablet and mobile spans can be altered by using extra helper classes depending on the project and the requirements. Tablet and phone base stylesheets include helper classes for full, half and third (widths) which override default column behaviour.

### File structure
We advise to create one file for each individual section / size and place it in ts respective folder. All files will compile to two main stylesheets and a IE fallback stylesheet that should include all desktop size styles.

To keep it organised, you can add one file for each section, and add common (for each size) styles to the base.scss file. Common styles across the site should go in common.scss.
